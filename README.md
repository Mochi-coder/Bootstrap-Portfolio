# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created using Bootstrap! It includes components such as:
<li> Jumbotron
<li> Cards
<li> Buttons
<li> Navbar
This challenge demonstrates how much easier it is to create a webpage with the help of Bootstrap. 
Difficulties I faced creating this portfolio was trying to ensure the height of the cards were all the same.

## Usage

This is a current screenshot of my portfolio.

Similar to My First Portfolio, on this page you will find buttons that direct you to my work as well as ways to contact me.
